	Algorithms Project
	
	INTRODUCTION
	
	Someday I was just bored and decided to
learn a new programming language. My choice was Ruby and, I'll tell you, I do not regret it.
I really appreciate algorithms and data structures, so at the time I thought
implementing sorting algorithms was a good way to get the hang of the
language basics. This project is the result of my learnings, and I
release it as GPLv3 to the world. :)
	
	The development is based on Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms:

	@book{Cormen:2001:IA:580470,
	 author = {Cormen, Thomas H. and Stein, Clifford and Rivest, Ronald L. and Leiserson, Charles E.},
	 title = {Introduction to Algorithms},
	 year = {2001},
	 isbn = {0070131511},
	 edition = {2nd},
	 publisher = {McGraw-Hill Higher Education},
	}

	In the future, I might add new algorithms as I please, like graph
algorithms.

	USAGE
	
	If you want to run the sorting algorithms right away, I wrote a small script
called Sort/Sort.rb that invokes each one of the sorting algs. using a dummy array.
It also outputs the running time of each algorithm, so you can have a "taste" of the
different complexities (also, you can export the timings and plot nice graphs if you
deserve to :). 
	All the algorithms are commented in Portuguese (sorry if you're unfamiliar with
the language). In the future I plan to replace my pt_BR comments to en_US ones. Well,
anyway, it's Ruby. You can read the scripts almost as they were coded in plain English :)


This is it. Enjoy.
